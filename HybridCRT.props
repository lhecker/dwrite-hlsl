    Windows App SDK coined this the "Hybrid CRT" model and that's the search term to use if needed.
    But really, all this does is to dynamically link with the CRT (C), because that one is
    always present on Windows, and statically with the vcruntime (C++), because that one isn't.
    If you need this for Debug builds, replace:
    * MultiThreaded -> MultiThreadedDebug
    * libucrt -> libucrtd
    * ucrt -> ucrtd
